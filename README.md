Use Wolfram Alpha for general knowledge questions

![](./ui/logo.png)


## About
Ask general-knowledge queries of your Mycroft device. 
CommonQuery skill for [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com). 
You'll be surprised by how much it knows!

You can also explicitly request to "ask the wolf"

NOTE: this is meant to be a better alternative to the official mycroft skill, it will blacklist the official skill!!

## Examples
* "ask the wolf what is the speed of light"
* "How tall is Mount Everest?"
* "When was The Rocky Horror Picture Show released?"
* "What is Madonna's real name?"
* "What's 18 times 4?"
* "How many inches in a meter?"
